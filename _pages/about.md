Currently doing my 4th year of Engineering physics and Electroengineering programme at Lule√• University of technology. Starting my master education in Computational methods and physics this fall. Interessed mainly in theoretical physics, currently mainly intresst in
* Quantum physics
  * Quantum field theory
* Condensed matter physics
  * Solid state physics

Will use website to develop some skill in CSS and also to be able to show what Im doing in my last two years at LTU.


A test website for evolving trought my masters degree and towards entering a PHD programme
======
It is my intention to start a PHD in theoretical physics after my master degree at LTU is done. At the moment my goal is to develop good computational skills that can be used in a future reasearch setting. Also of course finishing my degree with as good of a academic record as possible.

Hopefully this year i can start to help with some reasearch at the school to get some publications in my name.
